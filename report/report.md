# Probelm Statement and Motivation
This should be a brief and self-contained decription of the problem that your project aims to solve and what motivated you to solve this problem.

# Introduction and Description of Data
Description of relevant knowledge. Why is this problem important? Why is it challenging? Introduce the motivations for the project question and how that question was defined through preliminary EDA.

# Literature Review/Related Work 
This could include noting any key papers, texts, or websites that you have used to develop your modeling approach, as well as what others have done on this problem in the past. You must properly credit sources.

# Modeling Approach

+ Describe the baseline model.
+ Describe your implementations beyond the baseline model and the design choices that you have made.

# Project Trajectory, Results, and Interpretation 

Briefly summarize any changes in your project goals or implementation plans you have made.
These changes are a natural part of any project, even those that seem the most straightforward at the beginning.
The story you tell about how you arrived at your results can powerfully illustrate your process. 

Next, show your results. How well does your model and/or implementation perform? Did you meet your goals?

Finally, give some interpretation. What do your results mean? What impact will your work have?

# Conclusions and Future Work
Summarize your results, the strengths and short-comings of your results, and speculate on how you might address these short-comings if given more time.

# References:
This could include the revised key papers, texts, or websites that you may use to develop your project.

# Support Materials
Provide a list of materials that support your project, for example, the notebooks and data sources.
